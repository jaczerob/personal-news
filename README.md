# Personal News

This is my Data Mining project for Georgia State University Spring 2021. This is meant to be an easy to use web API for providing users personalized news with a truthfulness score based on ratings of news from other users using the SVD algorithm.

The purpose of this repository is for display of code only.


# How it works

The recommendation system works based on the SVD algorithm by predicting what a given user likes based on what they like and what other users liked.

The truthfulness score works by predicting based on the dataset from William Yang Wang: Liar, Liar Pants On Fire. This is done using https://github.com/nishitpatel01/Fake_News_Detection.
